The marketing industry has long obsessed over "actionable insights"—data gleaned from past campaigns. But here is the harsh reality in 2026: **Insight is too slow.** 

By the time you see the dashboard indicating a drop in ROAS, the market has already moved on. Post-campaign analytics, in this context, constitute a massive operational liability.

### The Mortar AI & DAIVID Example

Recent partnerships, such as Mortar AI & DAIVID, highlight a desperate industry pivot toward predictive logic. But predictive *demographics* are insufficient if you aren't predicting *creative decay*.

The speed at which a new creative convention (a "schema") becomes saturated is accelerating. What worked six weeks ago won't work tomorrow.

### From Insight to Forensic Foresight

Elite agencies require a <LexiconLink term="Sovereign Data Layer" />. They don't just need to know what happened; they need to know *what is about to happen*. This is where the Market Saturation Index comes in.

By mathematically tracking the velocity of specific <LexiconLink term="Execution Tactics" /> across a given niche, we can pinpoint the exact moment a creative approach crosses into ad-fatigue.

### The End of the "Test and Learn" Era

"Test and Learn" is an expensive euphemism for "Guessing with Budget." The modern analytical mandate is "Decompile and Exploit." 

When you possess real-time, forensic foresight into your competitors' deployment velocity, you don't test concepts against the market—you engineer concepts specifically to exploit the weaknesses in current market saturation curves.
